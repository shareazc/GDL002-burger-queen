Taking orders as a server in a restaurant might be the most chaotic task ever, studies have found that 
the average server is under more stress than a neurosurgeon and understandably so! Imagine trying to juggle
a number of food orders from different people, possibly with changes or modifications to the original dish 
several times a day. 

So this project is intended to make that task easier by loading the menu to a realtime database that can
be edited by the restaurant's staff. Let's imagine that our server now has a tablet instead of a note pad
and whenever they need to take an order for someone, they just need to tap on the food item and it will
be automaticaly added to the total amount. This too can be modified in case the client modifies their order. 

In this first iteration we are able to take an order and add it up to a total sum.
